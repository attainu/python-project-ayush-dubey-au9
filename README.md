<h2>What is Bitcoin ?</h2>

<p1>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.
It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.</p1>

<h3>Problem Faced By Users:</h3>

<p2>The main issue with bitcoin is that it is "Ficle in nature"  as its value changes every second.</p2>
